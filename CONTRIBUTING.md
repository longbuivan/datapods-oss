# Contributing to DataPods

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DataPods as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## DataPods is an Open Source Project

If you would love to contribute to DataPods, you probably want to contribute into the [datapods-server] folder, where all the platform code, codebase, and infrastructure are located. a [datapods-app] is the frontend and landing page for this project, but welcome to contribute and make it better.

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
